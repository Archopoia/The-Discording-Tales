There are 3 essential steps to a Character’s Revelation ( the “ creation ” of a character that you will play through the game ). Each Step can be approached in a simple, general, and fairly quick manner, or by Varying ( advanced rules ), making your- self more unique and divergent from the norm while respecting the laws of rarity. In either case, proceed as follows:

- Your Characteristics ( A, p. 61 ) define how the universe measures and interacts with you, through your Attributes ( see next spread pages ) based on who you are ( your Origin, People, and Race ), from which also derive your typical Fat, Stature, Height, and Dimorphism, giving you the default Attribute and Aptitude Lvls tied to your roots.
- Your Individuation ( B, p. 65 ) reveals how you differ from the norm, making you a unique individual by altering your default Attributes as previously derived.
- Your Tale ( C, p. 67 ), which justifies and explains your existence up until now and through these initial steps.
AFTER these 3 fundamental steps ( and some rules ), you will have two possible choices :

- Continue your Revelation in a delayed and simplified manner, like a healing from amnesia through the first game sessions themselves ( see the Creative Remembrance on p. 81 ), to better establish your choices by becoming aware of your needs through those sessions, rather than imagining and making decisions “at random” without really knowing the importance of those options and choices.
- Thus, when you Awaken from your Tale, you will have “amnesias,” from which you will recover memory in 8 aspects of life during the session, concerning...
- A) Life experience ( related to the skills they would have learned )
- B) Integrity ( related to motivations that will help them make decisions )
- C) Society ( related to material or non - material possessions necessary to get by )
- OR , alternatively, finalize the Revelation directly before the first session using these aspects :
- Your Symbol ( A, p. 149 ) determining your nature, essence, destiny, duty, passions, or even pure chance that makes you inclined toward certain facets of reality.
- Your Education ( A, p. 153 ) from early child- hood to young adulthood.
- Your Expression ( A, p. 155 ) formed over time, defining your abilities.
- Your Values ( B, p. 161 ) that maintain your mental health and drive you toward your goals.
- Your Traits ( B, p. 171 ) guiding your reac- tions, desires, and dislikes toward other beings.
- Your Titles ( C, p. 179 ) revealing, proving, and justifying your place within the different hierarchies of the world.
- Your Languages ( C, p. 181 ) allowing access to certain societies or knowledge.
- Your Wealth ( C, p. 183 ) granting you the ability to acquire goods and services offered to you.
