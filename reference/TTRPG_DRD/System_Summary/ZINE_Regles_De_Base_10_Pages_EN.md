# PAGE 1 : The concept

## The Discording Tales

**A game where failure forges the hero.**

Each failure brings you closer to mastery. Sufferings are not punishments but narrative drivers. At 10+ Sufferings you enter Rage; at 15+, Blackout. Each Suffering also teaches you something.

**The 3 principles**

1. **Failure = progression** — Each failure in a possible action gives one experience Mark. 10 Marks = Realisation = +1 Die in the Skill.
2. **Sufferings = drivers** — The 8 Sufferings create situations, choices and dilemmas. How do you handle your Rage? Your Insanities? Your Grudges?
3. **Mechanical personality** — Your Values heal your Insanities. Your Traits heal your Grudges. Personality is not cosmetic, it is mechanical.

**To play**

- **1 Revealer** (Game Master)
- **2–6 Awakeners** (Players)
- **3 three-sided dice per player** (or d6: 1–2 = −, 3–4 = 0, 5–6 = +)

# PAGE 2 : The setting

## Iäoduneï

Play region: **Iäoduneï**, land of snow dunes, burning waters and central mountains (~200,000 inhabitants). Key places: Dla'Adur, Lumioleï, Ajolum Mountains, Blown Deserts, Great Thermal Lakes.

**Techno-traditionalism** — The world blends tradition and technology. Motivations oppose the order of **Folk** (society, customs) and **Things** (nature, technology).

**Cosmogony in brief** — Most cultures believe they live in a concave universe (Cytocosmism), with no creation ex nihilo: **infinite continuity**. The invisible world is explained by **braided cords**; their knots are the **Rils**. **Ô** is the rilical spirit forming all forms, eternally between pain and relief. **Rilie** (magic) arises from interaction with the Rils, orchestrated by four forces (Whirling, Tension, Alignment, Torsion).

## Peoples (in a word)

| People      | In brief                |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Aristois   | Sovereign warriors      |
| Griscribes | Nested sages            |
| Navillis   | Joyful navigators       |

# PAGE 3 : The dice

## Discordant Dice (dD)

**3 faces**: `+`, `−`, `0`.

**Roll result**: number of `+` minus number of `−`.

**Examples**: `++−0−` = 2 − 1 = **+1** ; `+++00` = **+3** ; `−−000` = **−2** ; `00000` = **0** (tie).

**No special dice?** d6: 1–2 = `−`, 3–4 = `0`, 5–6 = `+`.

## Levels (Niv)

- **Attribute Niv**: −5 to +5 (0 = average).
- **Aptitude Niv**: computed from 3 Attributes.
- **Skill Niv**: 0 to 5 (Novice → Master).
- **Trial Niv**: difficulty of the action (−5 to +10+).

---

# PAGE 4 : Making a roll

## Formula

**Result = Niv + Dice**

- **Niv** = Aptitude Niv + modifiers (equipment, situation).
- **Dice** = 5 Luck Dice + Skill Dice + Potential Dice.
- **Success**: Result ≥ Trial Niv.
- **Failure**: Result < Trial Niv → +1 experience Mark.

## Example

Climbing a wall (Trial Niv +2). Athletics Niv +1, [Climb] Niv 2 with +3 Dice, equipment +1 Niv.

- Niv: +1 + 1 = **+2**
- Dice: 5 (Luck) + 3 ([Climb]) = **8dD**
- If result ≥ +2: success. If < +2: failure, +1 Mark in [Climb].

## Criticals

- **Critical failure**: all dice are `−` → 5 Marks instead of 1.
- **Critical success**: all dice are `+` → special effect.

# PAGE 5 : Quick creation

## 1. Choose a people

Aristois, Griscribes, Navillis, Méridiens, Tall Ylfes, Pale Ylfes, Lake Ylfes, Slaadéens, Tchalkchaïs (see page 2).

## 2. Base attributes

Each people has base Attributes. Add **+2, +1, 0, 0, 0, 0, −1, −2** where you like.

**The 8 Attributes**: **FOR** (Strength), **AGI** (Agility), **DEX** (Dexterity), **VIG** (Vigor), **EMP** (Empathy), **PER** (Perception), **CRÉ** (Creativity), **VOL** (Willpower).

## 3. Aptitudes

Each Aptitude = average of 3 Attributes:

- **Power** (FOR, AGI, DEX) — **Ease** (AGI, DEX, VIG) — **Precision** (DEX, VIG, EMP) — **Athletics** (VIG, FOR, AGI)
- **Charisma** (EMP, PER, CRÉ) — **Detection** (PER, CRÉ, VOL) — **Reflection** (CRÉ, VOL, FOR) — **Domination** (VOL, FOR, EMP)

# PAGE 6 : Skills and Symbol

## Skills

Choose **3 Skills**. Give **+3 Dice** to one (family), **+2 Dice** to another (racial), **+1 Die** to the last (popular).

**Examples**: [Armed], [Dodge], [Aim], [Climb], [Negotiation], [Investigation], [Medicine], [Intimidation], etc. (72 total, 3 per Aptitude).

## Symbol

Your **highest Attribute** determines your Symbol (destiny / passion). It gives **3 Skills** with **3 Eternal Marks** each (they count for progression).

E.g. FOR highest → Power Symbol → [Armed], [Unarmed], [Wrestling].

## Values and Traits

- **1 Morality**: +6 Dice (inherited from people).
- **1 Motivation**: +3 Dice (toward Folk or Things).
- **1 Sociality**: +6 Dice (by age).

# PAGE 7 : The Sufferings

## The 8 Sufferings

Each Suffering is tied to an Attribute:

1. **Wounds** (FOR) — 2. **Fatigues** (AGI) — 3. **Hindrances** (DEX) — 4. **Need** (VIG)
5. **Addictions** (EMP) — 6. **Diseases** (PER) — 7. **Insanities** (CRÉ) — 8. **Grudges** (VOL)

## How you get them

**Failure in a possible Trial** → Sufferings by severity:

- Light: 1–2 Suffering Dice (DS)
- Moderate: 3–5 DS → Temporary sequela
- Severe: 6–9 DS → Lasting sequela
- Critical: 10–11 DS → Permanent sequela

E.g. fall → Wounds; sleepless night → Fatigues; hunger → Need; fear → Insanities; anger → Grudges.

## Suffering Dice (DS)

DS apply as **negative dice** to rolls tied to the affected Attribute. E.g. 5 Wounds (FOR) → −5 Dice to all Power rolls.

---

# PAGE 8 : Thresholds, Rage, Healing

## Thresholds

- **3–5 DS**: Temporary sequela
- **6–9 DS**: Lasting sequela
- **10–11 DS**: Permanent sequela
- **15–20 DS**: Fatal sequela

## Rage and Blackout

- **10+ total Sufferings**: **Rage Niv 1** — Roll 1d6 > Rage Niv to act rationally; otherwise act on instinct.
- **15+ total Sufferings**: **Blackout / Dementia** — Exchange 1 Rage Niv for each new Suffering; roll 1d6 > Blackout to be able to act.
- **21+ Sufferings**: **Defeated** — Coma or permanent insanity.

## Healing

- **Values**: heal Insanities (CRÉ).
- **Traits**: heal Grudges (VOL).
- **Treatments**: heal other Sufferings.
- **Resistance**: use a resisting Skill to reduce Sufferings received.

# PAGE 9 : Combat and Rilie

## Combat (simplified)

- **Beats**: 1/3 of a second. Real-time combat.
- **Alert Beats**: determine who can Proact (attack, move, manipulate).
- **Reactions** (Block, Parry, Dodge) on the **last beat** of the enemy’s attack.
- **Shake Niv**: accumulated from Reactions; reduces your rolls (e.g. 3 Shake → −3 Niv).
- **Damage**: successful attack → Wounds by margin (e.g. +1 to +2: 1–2 DS; +3 to +4: 3–5 DS; +5+: 6–9 DS).

## Rilie (magic)

Magic arises from interaction with the **Rils** (fundamental forms of the world), orchestrated by four Tetrarchs: Whirling, Tension, Alignment, Torsion. **Rilical Honorations** are ritual actions (sacrifices, oaths, offerings) to gain effects (healing, resistance, damage, etc.). Reveal as a Skill; see the rulebook for rilical circles and families.

# PAGE 10 : Experience and example

## Experience

- **1 Mark** per failure in a possible Trial (5 on critical failure).
- **Eternal Marks** (Symbol): do not count for progression.
- **10 Marks** (excluding Eternal) in a Skill = **Tested Skill** → +1 Die to the Skill, free Marks elsewhere, +1 to linked Attribute.
- **Distinction** = sum of Attribute Nivs; every +10 Distinction: +1 to an Attribute and Attribute Discovery.

## Play example

Negotiating with a merchant (Trial Niv +2). Charisma +3, [Negotiation] Niv 2 with +2 Dice, 8 Insanities (−8 Dice), Generosity Value +3 Dice.

- Base: 5 + (2dD − 8dD + 3dD) = **5 − 3dD**. Roll `−−0` = −2 → Total **3**. 3 ≥ 2 → **Marginal success.**
If failure: Grudges (VOL), possible Rage at 10+ Sufferings; in any case, failure = +1 Mark in [Negotiation].
